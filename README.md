# Project
Programs in folders soup and selenium can be evalueted by python3 interpreter.

Folder scrapy contain three spider files that have to be copy to relevant scrapy project folder and can be run with scrapy crawl commands (do this in this order):

File Scrapy_WTA_1.py command: 	scrapy crawl WTA_1 -o WTA1.csv

File Scrapy_WTA_2.py command: 	scrapy crawl WTA_2 -o WTA2.csv

File Scrapy_WTA_3.py command: 	scrapy crawl WTA_3 -o WTA3.csv

and one file Scrapy_not_Scrapy.py that can be evalueted by python3 interpreter. 
You have to put it in the folder (not scrapy project folder) and copy WTA2.csv and WTA3.csv into that folder in order to work properly.
